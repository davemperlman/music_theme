	<h2>About Dave Perlman</h2>

		I am a musician and live performer/entertainer from Maine. Versatility in accommodations is a point of pride for me in my business. As a multi-instrumentalist with a diverse background in musical performance, I strive to deliver whatever a project demands to the best of my ability.
