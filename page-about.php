	<h2>About Dave Perlman</h2>
	<p>
		I am a musician and live performer/entertainer from Maine. I started this venture simply because I love playing music and have for over 15 years. As an entertainer, my goal is to utilize my abilities to best suit my reason for hire. I've performed at weddings, functions, as well as restaurants and nightclubs. Every performance brings me new experiences and often times new friends.

		I play a variety of instruments and have been fortunate to have played and to be currently playing with many talented musicians. As this page is dedicated to my business's events, I won't always have events with my band(s) posted although you'll be able to follow all of my dates via my <a href="http://www.facebook.com/entertainmentmaine">Facebook</a> page.

	<p>
		I've been extremely blessed to have the support of many dedicated friends, family, and followers as well the the support and kindness of the numerous businesses that deem my abilities worthy for hire. It's very flattering and humbling to have such an overwhelming amount of support from my community and so I thank each and every one of you.
